# Realtime-Currency-Converter

  This is a currency converter which uses a seperate API to fetch data and to convert the currencies selected.
  
  You can claim you free API KEY in "https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key"
  
  Nowadays many people are interested in currency exchange rates. This thought made me to think about it and I have started searching about the APIs available in internet.
  At last I made it to happen using python.
  
  Hope you enjoy it.
  
 ## Thank you
